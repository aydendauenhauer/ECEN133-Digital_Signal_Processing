This repository contains my Lab 5 work for ECEN 133, where I used MATLAB to design and compare several audio filters for speech and test signals. The lab builds 1 kHz IIR notch filters with different pole radii, then designs FIR bandpass and bandstop filters using both fir1 (windowed-IDTFT) and firpm (Parks–McClellan), and finally implements equivalent Butterworth IIR bandpass/bandstop filters. I verified each design with pole–zero plots and frequency responses, applied them to real audio, and analyzed their effect using spectrograms and time-domain plots.
