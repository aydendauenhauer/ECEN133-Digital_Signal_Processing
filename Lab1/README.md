This repository contains my Lab 1 work for ECEN 133. In this lab I used MATLAB Live Scripts to review basic vector operations and plotting, generate and play sampled sinusoids, and explore simple first-order IIR filters by driving them with different inputs (impulse, square wave, and low-frequency cosine) and examining their time-domain responses. The exercises introduce discrete-time signals, indexing, and the relationship between input and output for basic filters as a foundation for later DSP labs.
