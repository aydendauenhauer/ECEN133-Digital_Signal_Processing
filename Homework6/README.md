This repository contains my Homework 6 for ECEN 133, where I used MATLAB to analyze the DFT of sampled cosine signals with different lengths and zero-padding, study the effect of additive noise on spectral peaks, explore IIR notch filter design by examining poles and zeros in the z-plane, and design FIR bandpass filters using both windowed-sinc (fir1) and Parks–McClellan (firpm) methods (including weighted designs).
