This repository contains my Homework 4 for ECEN 133, where I used MATLAB to explore the DTFT of finite-length sequences and the design of notch filters. The code computes and plots the magnitude of the DTFT for rectangular pulses of different lengths, then designs FIR and IIR notch filters centered at 1 kHz for various sampling rates, examining their frequency responses and pole-zero locations with freqz and zplane.
