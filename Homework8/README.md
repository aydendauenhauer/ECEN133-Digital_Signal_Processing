This repository contains my Homework 8 for ECEN 133, where I used MATLAB to implement an LMS adaptive filter to identify an unknown FIR system from noisy input/output data, sweep over several step sizes, and plot both the squared error and the final learned tap weights. The script then repeats the experiments with scaled input amplitude to examine how the optimal step size should scale to preserve convergence behavior.
