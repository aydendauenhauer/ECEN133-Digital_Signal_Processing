# ECEN133-Digital_Signal_Processing
ECEN 133 – Digital Signal Processing lab, implemented in MATLAB. The goal of these labs is to practice core DSP concepts, including discrete-time Fourier analysis, sampling and aliasing, filter design (FIR and IIR), frequency-domain analysis, and practical signal processing of real and synthetic data.
