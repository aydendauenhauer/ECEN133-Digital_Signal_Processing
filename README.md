# ECEN133-Digital_Signal_Processing
This repository contains my ECEN 133 – Digital Signal Processing lab, implemented in MATLAB at Santa Clara University. The goal of these labs is to practice core DSP concepts, including discrete-time Fourier analysis, sampling and aliasing, filter design (FIR and IIR), frequency-domain analysis, and practical signal processing of real and synthetic data. The repository includes source files for the lab implementations as well as any helper functions, scripts, and supporting documentation. This project is shared for personal reference and portfolio purposes only. If you are currently enrolled in ECEN 133, please do not copy this work or submit it as your own. Follow SCU’s academic integrity policies.
