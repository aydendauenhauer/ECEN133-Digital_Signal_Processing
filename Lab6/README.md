This repository contains my Lab 6 project for ECEN 133, where I implemented real-time audio processing on the STM32L476-DISCO development board. The lab plays sweep and chirp signals from a USB flash drive, uses joystick buttons for volume control and filter enable/disable, and implements several FIR-based filters (high-pass, low-pass, and band-stop) in C by processing incoming samples in an 8 kHz interrupt-driven filter() routine.
