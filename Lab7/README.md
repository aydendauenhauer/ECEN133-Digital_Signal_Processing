This repository contains my Lab 7 project for ECEN 133, where I implemented real-time audio filters on the STM32L476-DISCO board using circular buffers. The lab converts earlier 4th-order FIR and 2nd-order IIR designs into circular-buffer form, then adds Butterworth and Parks–McClellan bandpass/bandstop filters and an echo effect by reading delayed samples from a large buffer; an extra-credit extension applies cosine amplitude modulation to the live audio stream. The repository includes C source code for the interrupt-driven filter() routine, coefficient files, and the written report describing listening tests and design behavior.
