This repository contains my Lab 2 project for ECEN 133, where I used MATLAB to generate sampled tone sequences at 8 kHz, construct the corresponding time vector, and play the signal back as audio. The lab then designs a simple moving-average FIR filter, analyzes its frequency response with freqz, and applies it to the tone sequence to compare the original and filtered signals in both the time domain and by listening.
