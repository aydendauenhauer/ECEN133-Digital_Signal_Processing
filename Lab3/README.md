This repository contains my Lab 3 project for ECEN 133, where I used MATLAB to design and analyze narrowband FIR bandpass filters for DTMF row frequencies (697 Hz and 770 Hz), apply them to synthesized multi-tone phone keypad signals, and study how filter length and bandwidth affect selectivity. The lab implements envelope detection with rectification and moving-average smoothing, chooses thresholds to robustly detect which row frequency is present, and explores the impact of added noise on detection performance.
